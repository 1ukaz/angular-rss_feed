# New York Times RSS Feed - AngularJS

Use this application to quickly test Lucas Guegnolle's (Limited) Skills.

This application is a small widget to embed via AJAX in any Site.

It gives the latest news from The New York Times.

## Install the Application

* Clone this Repository: `git clone https://github.com/1ukaz/angular-rss_feed.git`

* Get inside the folder where you cloned into: Defaults to `angular-rss_feed`

## Run it!

* You will need to run it under some sort of Web Server, since ti performs an AJAX call to do the loading.

* Execute `php -S 127.0.0.1:8100` to run PHP Built in Server for instance, or you can run a NodeJS Server.

* Go ahead with the Browser and hit: `http://127.0.0.1:8100`. You should see the News list.

* That's it! Now go and hire the poor devil!

* You can customi(s|z)e this in any way you need to.
* Improvement suggestions are always welcome!
* AngularJS is not my strongest suit!
